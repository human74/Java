After graduation, Muskrat began working at the Haskell Institute as a teacher,[6] and then as head of the college placement bureau. She won the Henry Morgenthau Prize in 1926 for best use of her college education in the first year graduation.[13][5]

In 1928, Muskrat married John F. Bronson and they adopted a native girl.[14]

In 1931, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) created a new program to improve educational opportunities for Native Americans. Bronson was appointed as the first Guidance and Placement Officer of the bureau and tasked with helping graduates find viable employment.[15][16] In 1937, she was awarded the Indian Achievement Medal of the Indian Council Fire, the second woman to have received the award since its inception.[17] She had previously been nominated for the award in its inaugural year in 1933.[18] Bronson was in charge of distributing government loans and scholarships for students, as well as helping them find jobs. She worked at the BIA until 1943.[5]


Ruth Muskrat Bronson, 1947
Bronson spent a few years out of the workforce raising her daughter.[5] During this period, she wrote and published several books and articles, including Indians are People Too (1944),[19] The Church in Indian Life(1945),[20] and Shall We Repeat Indian History in Alaska? (1947).[21]

In 1945, Bronson began working with the recently established National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) and soon emerged as a leader. She was appointed as the executive secretary of the organization and spent a decade monitoring legislative issues. She also established the NCAI's legislative news service.[6] During this period, she spoke at numerous tribal meetings throughout the country, promoting Native American progress.[22] Bronson advocated such issues as native water rights along the Colorado River,[23] native rights in the Territory of Alaska,[24] and gaining quality medical care for American Indians. After ten years of serving as executive secretary, in 1955 Bronson was elected as treasurer of the NCAI.[25] Tired of the contentiousness of national politics, she focused on ways to work directly with local communities.[6]

In 1957, Bronson moved to Arizona, where she served as a health education specialist at the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation for the Indian Health Service (part of the Department of Health and Human Services).[6] During the same period, she served as a vice president of the philanthropic ARROW Organization. She managed the education loan and scholarship fund of the organization, as well as advising tribes on community development. In 1962, Bronson was awarded the Oveta Culp Hobby Service Award from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare for her work serving Native Americans[26] and retired from government service.

She moved to Tucson.[27] In 1963, Bronson became the national program chairman of the Community Development Foundation’s American Indian section. The organization operated under the umbrella of the Save the Children Federation.[28] After a stroke in 1972, Bronson slowed, but did not stop her activism for Native Americans. She advocated their determining their own development and leadership programs.[29] In 1978, Bronson was among recipients of the National Indian Child Conference's merit award for commitment to improving children's quality of life.[30]

Bronson died on June 12, 1982, in Tucson, Arizona.[31]
In 1922, Muskrat went to Peking, China for an international youth conference as part of a YWCA delegation. She was one of the first Native American women to serve as a student delegate abroad.[9] The trip, which included stops in "Hawaii, Manchuria, Japan, Korea and Hong Kong." brought Muskrat to the attention of the international press. She was inspired to work for racial equality.[8]

The following year, Muskrat delivered an appeal to the United States government for better educational facilities for Native Americans.[10] She made the presentation at a gathering of Native American leaders, which was known as the "Committee of One Hundred", to advise President Coolidge on American Indian policy. Muskrat advocated for Indians to be involved in solving their own problems.[6] Moved by her speech,[11] President Calvin Coolidge and his wife, Grace, invited Muskrat to lunch with them.[10]
At the age of fourteen, Muskrat enrolled in preparatory school[7] at the Oklahoma Institute of Technology in Tonkawa, graduating in 1916. She furthered her education at Henry Kendall College in Tulsa and at Northeastern State Teachers College.[6] Financial hardship forced her to stop classes, and she taught for two years to earn sufficient funds to continue her schooling.[8]

In 1919, Muskrat enrolled at the University of Oklahoma,[7] where she studied for three semesters.[6] During the summer of 1921, she worked for the YWCA and was sent to work on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in New Mexico. Her report on her organizing efforts earned her a scholarship to attend the University of Kansas,[8] where she studied for three more semesters.[6]

January 3 – Aero Flight 311, a Douglas DC-3C (registration OH-LCC) of the Finnish airline Aero, crashes near Kvevlax (Koivulahti) on approach to Vaasa Airport in Finland killing all 25 people on board. An investigation determines pilot error to be the cause of crash, finding that the captain and first officer were both exhausted for lack of sleep and were intoxicated at the time of the crash. It remains the deadliest air disaster to have occurred in Finland.
January 12 – At the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California, the crew of a United States Air Force Strategic Air Command B-58 Hustler led by Major E. J. Deutschendorf – the father of singer-songwriter John Denver – breaks six world records in a single flight, including five held by the Soviet Union. The B-58 sets a new world speed record for a flight carrying a 2,000-kilogram (4,409-pound) payload over a 2,000-kilometer (1,242-mile) course, achieving an average speed of 1,061.808 mph (1,709.836 km/hr). The flight also breaks the world speed records for average speed over the same distance carrying a 1,000-kilogram (1,610-pound) payload and carrying no payload and smashes the previous records for the distance in all three payload categories, which had been held by Soviet Tupolev Tu-104s flying at about half the average speed the B-58 achieves. The flight also sets a new record for average speed over a 1,000-km (621 mph) course, averaging 1,200 mph (1,932 km/hr).[2]
January 14 – At the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California, a U.S. Air Force Strategic Air Command B-58 Hustler sets a new world speed record for a flight carrying a 2,000-kilogram (4,409-pound) payload over a 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) course, averaging 1,284.73 mph (2,068.81 km/hr). The flight also breaks the world speed records for average speed over the same distance carrying a 1,000-kilogram (1,610-pound) payload and carrying no payload.[2] On February 28, the crew will receive the Thompson Trophy for the flight.[2]
January 24 – A United States Air Force B-52G Stratofortress carrying two Mark 39 thermonuclear bombs breaks up in mid-air over Faro, North Carolina, and crashes, killing three of its eight-man crew. The bombs do not arm themselves and one bomb is recovered. Travelling at over 700 miles per hour (1,127 km/hr), the second bomb lands in a swamp and buries itself to a depth of over 75 feet (23 meters); flooding prevents its recovery.
